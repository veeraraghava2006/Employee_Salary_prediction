# Employee_Salary_prediction
🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting employee salary categories using Machine Learning techniques. The model is built using the Adult Census Income Dataset, which contains demographic and employment-related attributes. The goal is to understand how various factors influence salary levels and gain hands-on experience with real-world data analysis and machine learning workflows.

This project was completed as part of a 6-week Artificial Intelligence internship conducted by Edunet Foundation in collaboration with AICTE and IBM SkillsBuild.

🎯 Objectives

To explore and understand a real-world structured dataset

To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To preprocess data for machine learning tasks

To build a basic machine learning model for salary prediction

To gain practical exposure to AI and ML fundamentals

📂 Dataset

Name: Adult Census Income Dataset
